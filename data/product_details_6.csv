Falls below knee, 37"" from high point of shoulder (based on a size 6). Product Details When it comes to quality and color, no one does cashmere quite like we do.

We didn't think our color library could get any better...then, we made tie-dyed cashmere. These one-of-a-kind sweater-dresses are hand-dyed in superrich colorways for a new take on the classic stripe.  To honor the future of this fiber, we're proud to join the Sustainable Fibre Alliance (SFA), an international nonprofit working to create a more sustainable cashmere supply chain. As the first U.S. member, we're supporting its efforts to ensure animal welfare, advocate for herding communities, restore grasslands and reduce cashmere's environmental footprint.
