Our version is made from a dense woolen blend from Magee 1866 (an Irish mill whose expertise with hearty yarns began with hand-weaving tweed over 150 years ago), so it can withstand chilly temps. It's cut with a clean, tailored look with a covered placket. And as an added bonus, it's cut to fit cleanly over our signature Ludlow suits. Wool/poly. Point collar. Partially lined slant side pockets, button closure. Dry clean. Import. Online only. Item AQ434.",7629

Size & Fit A more traditional full cut, roomier in the body and sleeves. Product Details The Oxford cloth button-down shirt is a quintessential wardrobe staple and a hallmark of old-school collegiate style. It's beloved for its easy versatility: It can dress up chinos or make a suit feel more relaxed. Our oxford is made from American Pima cotton, a species that has longer fibers than other varieties of cotton which makes it stronger, softer and less likely to pill. As an added bonus, it's engineered with mechanical stretch: The 100-percent cotton fabric is woven loosely, then washed, giving it natural elasticity without having any stretch fibers. We kept the collar unlined and a little on the long side, a nod to its Ivy League heritage. (Fun fact: Yale, Harvard and Cambridge also had shirt fabrics named after them, but none have stood the test of time as well as Oxford's.) Cotton. Button-down collar. Machine wash. Import.

"Slim Untucked cotton oxford shirt in big square Item AQ046 All sizes are US sizes. Quantity : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Prices include duties and taxes.     Size & Fit Based on our Slim fit, a tailored fit, cut slim through the body and sleeves. Designed to be worn untucked, our Untucked fit is 1 1/4"" shorter in the body and 1"" shorter in the sleeves. Product Details The oxford-cloth button-down shirt is a quintessential wardrobe staple and a hallmark of old-school collegiate style. It's beloved for its easy versatility: It can dress up chinos or make a suit feel more relaxed. Our oxford is made from American Pima cotton, a species that has longer fibers than other varieties of cotton which makes it stronger, softer and less likely to pill. As an added bonus, it's engineered with mechanical stretch: the 100 percent cotton fabric is woven loosely, then washed, giving it natural elasticity without having any stretch fibers. We kept the collar unlined and a little on the long side, a nod to its Ivy League heritage. (Fun fact: Yale, Harvard and Cambridge also had shirt fabrics named after them, but none have stood the test of time as well as Oxford's.) Cotton. Patch pockets. Machine wash. Import. Select stores.

"Everyday cashmere crewneck sweater in Donegal knit Item K7705 All sizes are US sizes. Quantity : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Prices include duties and taxes.     Product Details When it comes to quality and color, no one does cashmere quite like we do.

They're soft and warm, while still being lightweight, which means they're the perfect layer to wear on crisp autumn days, under a jacket in colder months...even with a tee on chilly summer nights.We introduce new everyday cashmere colors and patterns every season—like this flecked Donegal option— so there's always a new way to wear it.  To honor the future of this fiber, we're proud to join the Sustainable Fibre Alliance (SFA), an international nonprofit working to create a more sustainable cashmere supply chain.
