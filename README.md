# jcrew-bot
Scrape JCrew sitemap to build a search engine for products.

Uses TF-IDF along with cosine similarity to rank documents (product sites) based on user query.

The main logic is in the Jupyter Notebook file, but the data and model are exported to build a Slack Bot that does the same thing.
